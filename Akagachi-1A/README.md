CAD data for DIY Akagachi type1 mode A
====
## Overview  

This data to develop your own Akagachi eye component.  
Type-1 is a small one (eye siza: 30mm) and a compact mode.
- Merit : Compact, easy to modify
- Demerit : Brush servo moters that connected directly will lower the robustness
3D printable data and 3D cad data are available.
